This uses mTLS so you need server and client PEM (key and cert) files.

There are three ways to generate server and client PEM files:
1. Create a Golang app to generate those for you similar to: https://github.com/eliben/code-for-blog/blob/master/2021/tls/tls-self-signed-cert.go (run on client and server as well)
2. Run: go run /usr/local/go/src/crypto/tls/generate_cert.go (had issues with this on the client side)
3. Install mkcert https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert and use that with "mkcert localhost" (for client and server)

So, example of how to run this server would be:
go run rest.go -cert localhost.pem -key localhost-key.pem -clientcert ../restclient/clientcert.pem 

clientcert flag presents the location where I had the client certificate
cert and key are server's certificate and private key generated by mkcert

Using this client: https://gitlab.com/emir.hamidovic/restclient this server can be tested. So far, only the simplest /task endpoint is available with POST, GET, DELETE functionalities. Also, it's possible to use in memory (with maps) and mongodb implementations of the server.

When this server is running, to access it with a browser (for example Chrome), this can be used: https://velmuruganv.wordpress.com/2020/04/27/mtls-mutual-tls-authentication-chrome/ (certificates and keys mentioned here would be the ones from the client or in my case from ../restclient)
